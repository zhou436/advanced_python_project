# advanced_python_project
It is a simple FEM solver and plotter for 2D problem, considering the plasticity.
The inputs are the material properties and the geometry and mesh of the structure.
The outputs are:
1. Displacement field
2. Stress field
3. Strain field
4. Max effective stress field

The plots in current version are:
1. Oringinal geometry
2. Current geometry
3. Strain-stress curve

To solve:
1. Avoid the for loops
2. Better plot
